# Tråntørium COG — Charter

This repository contains the **Charter of the Tråntørium Continuity of Governance (COG)**.

COG exists to preserve legitimacy, process, and institutional memory during systemic disruption.  
It is not a seat of authority. It is a mechanism of survival.

The Charter defines:
- conditions under which continuity mechanisms activate
- constraints placed on authority during continuity operations
- ethical and procedural limits of emergency governance
- the process by which normal governance is restored

COG is intentionally minimal, auditable, and conservative.  
It is designed to endure failure — technical, political, and human.

## Scope

This repository documents governance doctrine only.

It does **not**:
- exercise power
- supersede consensus governance
- define permanent authority
- operate outside its chartered limits

Any attempt to expand or contract COG authority outside the amendment process defined herein is invalid.

## Stewardship

This repository is maintained by the **Architect of Record**, acting under the constraints of the Charter itself.

No maintainer possesses unilateral authority beyond that explicitly granted herein.
