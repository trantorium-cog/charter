# Amendment Process

The Charter may be amended only after restoration of normal governance.

Amendments require:
- full documentation of proposed changes
- justification and risk assessment
- unanimous consensus of the governing body

Emergency conditions do not permit amendment.

Any amendment granting additional authority to COG must meet the highest ethical and procedural scrutiny.
