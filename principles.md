# Foundational Principles

Tråntørium Continuity of Governance is governed by the following principles:

1. **Continuity over control**  
   Preservation of process takes precedence over consolidation of power.

2. **Constraint over discretion**  
   Authority exercised during continuity operations must be bounded and reviewable.

3. **Legitimacy over expediency**  
   Short-term efficiency must not compromise long-term legitimacy.

4. **Auditability over secrecy**  
   All continuity actions must be documented and subject to review.

5. **Restoration over permanence**  
   Continuity mechanisms exist solely to enable return to normal governance.
