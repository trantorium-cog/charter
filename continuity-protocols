# Continuity Protocols

Continuity protocols define the conditions under which COG becomes operational.

Activation requires:
- degradation or loss of standard governance mechanisms
- inability to reach quorum through normal processes
- verified threat to institutional continuity

COG activation is provisional and time-bounded.

During activation:
- authority is limited to preservation actions only
- no permanent laws may be enacted
- no structural changes may be introduced
- all actions are logged and timestamped

COG deactivation occurs automatically upon restoration of governance capacity.
