# Authority Constraints

COG possesses no inherent authority.

Any authority exercised under continuity conditions is:
- derivative
- temporary
- revocable
- reviewable

Explicitly prohibited actions include:
- expansion of executive power
- suspension of the amendment process
- modification of COG scope
- interference with restoration mechanisms

Violation of these constraints invalidates the action and triggers immediate review.
