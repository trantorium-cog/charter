# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains governance doctrine and continuity framework documentation only.

It does **not** operate production systems, execute code, or expose live infrastructure.

As such, traditional vulnerability reporting does not apply.

## Reporting Concerns

If you believe this repository contains:
- material errors that could undermine governance legitimacy
- ambiguities that could enable abuse of continuity authority
- language that weakens ethical or procedural constraints

You may report concerns privately.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

Concerns should be submitted in good faith and with the intent of preserving:
- legitimacy
- continuity
- ethical constraint

Public disclosure of alleged issues prior to review is discouraged.

---

## Contact

Security and integrity concerns may be reported via:

- GitHub private communication (preferred)
- Direct contact with the Architect of Record

All reports are reviewed under the constraints of the Charter itself.
